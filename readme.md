# The Black Arms is now RETIRED  
Due to recent events and all the pressure I will no longer be developing this  
I can't take anymore of the pressure and attacks I have sustained from TBA  
Yes I still remain on Discord, But I am officially ending TBA and all its projects  
Trigon.Systems will remain as I still own its Domain and work on it actively  
Do what you wish with the code in this repository, I no longer care anymore  
The code is public for a reason, I don't intend to work on this anymore  
Yes this code will still work, But when it eventually breaks I won't fix it  
I am PhoenixAceVFX, And I have officially ended this project
