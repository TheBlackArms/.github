# The Black Arms is now RETIRED  
Due to recent events and all the pressure I will no longer be developing this  
I can't take anymore of the pressure and attacks I have sustained from TBA  
Yes I still remain on Discord, But I am officially ending TBA and all its projects  
Trigon.Systems will remain as I still own its Domain and work on it actively   
I am PhoenixAceVFX, And I have officially ended this project
