# The Black Arms is now RETIRED  
Due to recent events and all the pressure I will no longer be developing this  
I can't take anymore of the pressure and attacks I have sustained from TBA  
Yes I still remain on Discord, But I am officially ending TBA and all its projects  
Trigon.Systems will remain as I still own its Domain and work on it actively   
I am PhoenixAceVFX, And I have officially ended this project  

# Come join [The Alpines](https://github.com/The-Alpines)  
The new project made to be ran by the community  
You can join [Our Discord Server Here](https://go.trigon.systems/Discord)
